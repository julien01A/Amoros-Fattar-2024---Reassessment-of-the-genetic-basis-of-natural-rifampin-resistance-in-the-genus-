# Reassessment of the genetic basis of natural rifampin resistance in the genus Rickettsia, Amoros & Fattar et al. 2024

In this study, we proceed **statistical analysis** of qPCR to determine the *Rickettsia lusitaniae* R-Om density in response to rifampin treatment. We then carry diverse **genomic analysis** in order to (i) construct the *rpoB* complete gene sequence of *R. lusitaniae* R-Om based on a previous metagenomic investigation (Duron et al. 2018), (ii) annotate 78 *Rickettsia* complete genomes from public datasets, (iii) perform phylogenomic analyses, and (iv) identify orthogroups specific to naturally resistant-rifampin Rickettsia species.

This GitHub page shares the command lines used for the statistical and genomic analysis, each in a dedicated file. 

These GitHub page shares exclusively analysis maded with command lines and/or script. Additionnal assays which have been realised in specific software without command line are not presented here (eg. the Unipro UGENE software for the rpoB alignment).
