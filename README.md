# Reassessment of the genetic basis of natural rifampin resistance in the genus Rickettsia, Amoros & Fattar et al. 2024

In this GitHub page, we share:
1. The **qPCR data** allowing us to determine the *Rickettsia lusitaniae* R-Om density in response to rifampin treatment.
2.The diverse **genomic analysis** enabling (i) the construction of the *rpoB* complete gene sequence of *R. lusitaniae* R-Om based on a previous metagenomic investigation (Duron et al. 2018), (ii) the annotation of the 78 *Rickettsia* complete genomes from public datasets, (iii) the phylogenomic analyses, and (iv) the identification of the orthogroups specific to naturally resistant-rifampin Rickettsia species.

These GitHub page shares exclusively analysis carried out with command lines and/or script. Additionnal assays which have been realised in specific software without command line are not presented here (eg. the Unipro UGENE software for the rpoB alignment).
