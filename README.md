# Reassessment of the genetic basis of natural rifampin resistance in the genus *Rickettsia*, Amoros & Fattar et al. 2024

In this study, we investigated the natural resistance patterns of *Rickettsia* species to rifampin. To do it, we first evaluated the rifampin effect on the *Rickettsia lusitaniae* R-Om strain infecting the *Ornithodoros moubata* tick species using qPCR assays. Then, we proceed comparative genomic analyses on a large dataset of *Rickettsia* genomes to explore the genetic basis of natural rifampin resistance.

This repository contains:
1. Both the **qPCR raw data** from the rifampin-treatment experiment and the **R script** used to determine the effect of treatment on the *Rickettsia lusitaniae* R-Om density
2. The command lines enabled for the **overall bioinformatic analyses** allowing (i) the construction of the *rpoB* gene complete sequence of *R. lusitaniae* R-Om strain based on a previous metagenomic investigation (Duron et al. 2018, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.038>), (ii) the annotation of the 78 *Rickettsia* complete genomes from public datasets, (iii) the phylogenomic analysis, and (iv) the identification of the orthogroups specific to naturally resistant-rifampin *Rickettsia* species.

This repository details exclusively analyses carried out with command lines and/or script. Additionnal analyses performed using specific softwares are not presented here (*e.g.* the Unipro UGENE software for the *rpoB* alignment).
