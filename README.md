# Reassessment of the genetic basis of natural rifampin resistance in the genus Rickettsia, Amoros & Fattar et al. 2024

In this study, we investigate the natural resistance patterns of *Rickettsia* species to rifampin. To do it, we first evaluate the rifampin effect on the Rickettsia lusitaniae R-Om strain using qPCR. Then, we proceed comparative genomic analysis to explore the genetic basis of natural rifampin resistance.

In this GitHub page, we share:
1. The **qPCR data** used to determine the *Rickettsia lusitaniae* R-Om density in response to rifampin treatment.
2. The command line enabled for the **genomic analysis** allowing (i) the construction of the *rpoB* complete gene sequence of *R. lusitaniae* R-Om based on a previous metagenomic investigation (Duron et al. 2018), (ii) the annotation of the 78 *Rickettsia* complete genomes from public datasets, (iii) the phylogenomic analyses, and (iv) the identification of the orthogroups specific to naturally resistant-rifampin Rickettsia species.

These GitHub page shares exclusively analysis carried out with command lines and/or script. Additionnal assays which have been realised in specific software without command line are not presented here (*eg.* the Unipro UGENE software for the *rpoB* alignment).
